Steps to start the project:

1. docker-compose up -d
2. docker ps (to check if Kafka and Zookeeper are running)


3. docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics --create \
  --topic shopping-events \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --partitions 1 \
  --replication-factor 1

The above command will create a Kafka topic (named "shopping-events")


4. docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

Check if the topic was created 

5. python3 send_events.py 

The above command will read the "2020-Feb.csv" file (our dataset) and will send events one by one 
to Kafka.

6. Open http://localhost:8080/ (this is the Kafka UI) and check if Kafka received the events. 
Please go to Topics -> select our topic -> then click on "Messages". You should see the messages 
received from the python script.
